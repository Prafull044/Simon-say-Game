# Simon-say-Game
The Simon Game tests and improves your memory and concentration. When the game starts, one color flashes — the player must click the same color. With each level, the sequence grows by one step, and the player has to recall the entire sequence in the correct order. If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends and shows “Game Over”.
