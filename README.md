🎮 Simon Says Game
Simon Game is a fun memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to repeat the color sequence shown by the computer — every round adds one new color, making it more challenging as you go!

The Simon Game tests and improves your memory and concentration.
When the game starts, one color flashes — the player must click the same color.

If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends and shows “Game Over”.
